# example of a recurrent neural network 

# a long short-term memory recurrent neural network for sequence classiÔ¨Åcation. 
#  The model expects 100 time steps of one feature as input. 
#  The model has a single LSTM hidden layer to extract features from the sequence, 
#   followed by a fully connected layer to interpret the LSTM output, 
#   followed by an output layer for making binary predictions
